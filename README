Problem:

Planning
In this project, you will gain experience with classical planning. First, download and install the FastDownward
package following the instructions from
http://www.fast-downward.org/ObtainingAndRunningFastDownward
It is probably easier to compile the code on a Linux Ubuntu machine.

Running Benchmarks
Follow the instructions found here
http://www.fast-downward.org/IpcPlanners
on how to run some of the fast planners available in the package.
As part of your project, you need to run one planner on three different benchmarks (choose any three from
the available benchmarks). Report the solution found by the planner in each case.

Creating your Own Benchmark
Write in PDDL the problem where the robot has to pick up objects and transfer them to desired locations.
More specifically, you are given several rooms R1; : : : ;Rn. Some of the rooms are connected with each
other. There are several objects O1; : : : ;Om, with at most one object per room. A robot is located in one of
the rooms. Your are also given goal rooms G1; : : : ;Gm for each of the objects. The robot can pick up only
one object at a time. There can be at most one object in a room. If the robot has picked up an object, it can
only go to a room that has no other objects.
You will need to first write the domain file which defines the predicates and the actions necessary to solve
this problem. You need to provide definitions for the following functions: MoveWithoutObject, MoveWith-
Object, Pickup, Release.
You also need to write a problem instance file which defines the initial and goal state. The problem instance
should correspond to the picture 'Prob.jpeg'.
Robot has to transfer object O1 in room R7, object O2 in room R2, and object O3 in room R9. Black
rectangles represent walls.

Solution:
The copy of solution and output file is in the 'Solution' folder.
